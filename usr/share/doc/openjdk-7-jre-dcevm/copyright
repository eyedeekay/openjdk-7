 "CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2
 .
 Certain source files distributed by Oracle, Inc. are subject
 to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but
 only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's
 header the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to
 the "Classpath" exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that
 accompanied this code."
 Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
 making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and
 conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
 As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
 permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
 executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
 and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
 choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
 the terms and conditions of the license of that module. An independent
 module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.
 If you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version
 of the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish
 to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
